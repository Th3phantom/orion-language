# Orion Compiler ðŸš€

**I BUILT MY OWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE!** 

Orion Compiler transforms .orion files into Python magic. From "print: Hello" to running code - witness my first compiler! âœ¨

## Features
- `print: "Hello"` â†’ Executable Python
- `let` variable declarations  
- Automatic compilation and execution
- Simple, readable syntax

## Quick Start
1. Clone this repository
2. Run: `python orion_compiler.py`
3. Create `.orion` files and watch them execute!

## Example
**hello.orion:**
print: "Hello World!"
let creator = "Orion Developer"
print: "Made by:"
print: Th3phantom


## The Journey
This project represents my first major step into software development and compiler design. From beginner to language creator! 

*"The expert in anything was once a beginner."*
